# Autonomy_Foundation
A foundational framework for autonomous systems derived from real-world experiments, focusing on epistemic validity, action gating, and confidence dynamics.
This repository serves as a container for foundational documentation related to autonomous systems.

The work focuses on:
- epistemic validity
- action gating
- confidence dynamics
- autonomy derived from real-world behavior

Detailed documentation and experimental notes are maintained as separate documents and will be uploaded independently.

## Status
Foundation-A and Phase-2 completed.
